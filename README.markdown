This project allows you to import a Cbus Toolkit project file (.xml) and automatically generate the required commands and feedback processing.

## How To Install
1. Download the release version of the [cfCBusJS.dll](https://github.com/CommandFusion/C-Bus-guiDesigner-Plugin/raw/master/bin/Release/cfCBusJS.dll)
2. Save the DLL to your `CommandFusion/plugins` folder (wherever you installed guiDesigner too).
3. Launch guiDesigner (close it and reopen if you already had it open).
